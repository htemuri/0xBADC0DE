My work routine has started feeling a bit stagnant, so I’m looking for something fresh to keep me learning. I’m using this space to document my journey through computer architecture, operating systems, networking, SRE best practices, and whatever else sparks my curiosity along the way.

Below is my personal phased roadmap for deepening my skills in computer systems, performance tuning, and advanced development. I’ll be marking tasks complete as I go.
